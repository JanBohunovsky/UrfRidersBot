### Configuration
Requires a file named `config.json` next to the executable.
The contents of the file should look like this:
```json
{
    "token": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "riot_api_key": "RGAPI-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```
To run this bot, you need to create [Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and optionally, if you want [Clash module](https://github.com/JanBohunovsky/UrfRidersBot/tree/master/Modules/Clash) enabled, you also need [Riot API key](https://developer.riotgames.com/).
